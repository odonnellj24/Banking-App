# Banking-App

The input to your program are two filenames, the first containing customer data and the second containing bank transactions.  Two sets of input files are being used for testing:

    customers01.csv
    transactions01.csv

and 

    customers02.csv
    transactions02.csv
    
    
    

Input customer data and banking transactions --- deposits and withdrawals ---

and update the customer data accordingly.  The program inputs the name of two 

files, the first containing customer data and the second containing 

banking transactions.  The program outputs the customer data in 

ascending order by name, processes the transactions, and then 

outputs the updated customer

data in descending order by 

customer balance 

---

if two customers have the same balance, the 

output is ordered by name

(ascending).
